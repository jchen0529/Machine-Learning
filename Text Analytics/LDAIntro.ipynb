    "**What is LDA model?**\n",
    "LDA represents documents as **mixture of topics** that spits out words with certain probabilities. It is a bag-of-words model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does LDA do?**\n",
    "It is a way of automatically discovering **topics** that sentences contain and is unsuperivised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LDA model assumption of how documents are written**\n",
    "It assumes that when writing each document, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* decide on the number of words N the document will have (say, to a Poisson distribution)\n",
    "* choose a topic mixture for the document ex: have a document to be about 1/3 food and 2/3 animals\n",
    "* generate each word w_i in the document by:\n",
    "    + first picking a topic (based on the topic's multinomial distribution)\n",
    "    + use the topic to generate the word itself\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming this generative model for a collection of documents, LDA then tries to backtrack from the documents to find a set of topics that are likely to have generated the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does LDA learn?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example where we have 5 documents, and we wanted to choose 2 topics to discover, then use LDA to learn the topic representation of each document and the words associated to each topic. How do you do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "One method is using collapsed Gibbs sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* go through each document, and randomly assign each word in the document to one of the K topics.\n",
    "    * This random assignment already gives you both topic representations to all the documents and word distributions of all the topics (although not very good)\n",
    "* to improve on the random guessing, for each document d_i:\n",
    "    * go through each word w_i in d_i:\n",
    "        * for each topic t, compute two things:\n",
    "            * p(topic t | document d_i) = prop of words in d_i that are currently assigned to topic t\n",
    "            * p(word w_i | topic t) = prop of assignments to topic t over all documents that come from this word w_i\n",
    "            * Reassign with a new topic, where we choose topic t with probability p(topic t | document d_i) * p(word w_i | topic t)\n",
    "            * In other words, we are assuming that all topic assignments except for the current word in question are correct, then update the assignment of the current word using our model of how docs are generated.\n",
    "            \n",
    "* Repeat the previous step a large number of times and you will eventually reach a steady state where your assignments are pretty good. Then these assignments will be used to estimate the topic mixtures of each document.\n",
