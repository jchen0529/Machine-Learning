I will record my learnings on different topics and share reproducible ML projects I've worked on as I continue my journey in data science.

### Projects

* **Retail company's catalog sales prediction**: Predict top spending customers and their purchase amounts by building a logistic regression model to predict customers' purchasing likelihood and a multiple regression model to predict customers' expenditures.
